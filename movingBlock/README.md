# movingBlock
## An interactive program that displays a block on a 16x2 LCD screen that is controlled by a standard joystick.

This project uses the same schematic for the LCD screen taken from my buttonState project. I have a custom character (a 4x4 pixel block) that is displayed on the screen, and a joystick that moves the block across the screen by altering the blocks current position (measured by it's X and Y values).

The program also checks if the block's current position is at any of the screen's extremities and if so, will not move the block off the screen.
