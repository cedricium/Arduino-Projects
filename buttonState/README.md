# buttonState
### An interactive program that displays whether or not a button is pushed.

For this project, I combined the ["Wiring a Character LCD"](https://learn.adafruit.com/character-lcds/wiring-a-character-lcd) tutorial from Adafruit and the ["Button"](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Button) tutorial from Arduino to have an LCD screen display if the button is being pushed or not.

This is my first-ever Arduino project and I was so happy with it that I decided to dedicate a blog post to it. Below is a gif of the project in action.
